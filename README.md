# Nginx Patches by MDounin 

## Background

This repo contains *experimental* patches by
[Maxim Dounin](http://mdounin.ru). Most *regular* patches end up
commited on Nginx [trunk](http://trac.nginx.org) so there's not much
point in providing them here. 

This is experimental stuff. As such all hell may break loose. You're
on your own. 

## Application

If any of the patches don't apply cleanly, they're moved to the `rejected`
directory.

This repository is provided as a **convenience** since as of now there's
no _official_ repo theses patches. They're being provided **solely**
through the mailing list.
