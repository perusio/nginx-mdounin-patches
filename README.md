# Nginx Patches by MDounin 

## Background

This is a repository that I mantain with patches provided by by [Maxim Dounin](http://mdounin.ru)
for Nginx. Most of these patches where provided in a
[thread](http://nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2011-June/000974.html)
of the [nginx-devel](http://nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel)
mailing list.

It includes also other patches posted to the
[nginx-devel](http://nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel) mailing list.

## Application

I applied the **non-rejected** patches to build my
[nginx deb](http://debian.perusio.net "My Debian Repo with up to date
Nginx") package of the **1.0.4** version.

If any of the patches don't apply cleanly, they're moved to the `rejected`
directory.

This repository is provided as a **convenience** since as of now there's
no _official_ repo of theses patches. They're being provided **solely**
through the mailing list.
