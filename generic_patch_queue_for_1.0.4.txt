Hello!
This is repost of my generic patch queue for nginx.  Included patches
were already posted on mailing lists (nginx@, nginx-ru@, nginx-devel@).
Most of these patches are independant and may be cherry-picked, though
some aren't or at least require merging if applied separately.
Testing reports are appreciated, as well as reviews.
